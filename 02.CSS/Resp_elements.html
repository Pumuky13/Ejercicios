        <h2>Free emulator</h2>
        <p> MAME's main purpose is to be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated machines. This is done both
            for educational purposes and for preservation purposes, in order to prevent historical software from
            disappearing forever once the hardware it runs on stops working. Of course, in order to preserve the
            software and demonstrate that the emulated behavior matches the original, you must also be able to actually
            use the software. This is considered a nice side effect, and is not MAME's primary focus.

            It is not our intention to infringe on any copyrights or patents on the original games. All of MAME's source
            code is either our own or freely available. To operate, the emulator requires images of the original ROMs,
            CDs, hard disks or other media from the machines, which must be provided by the user. No portions of the
            original game code are included in the executable. </p>

        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>MAME’s purpose is to preserve decades of software history. As electronic technology continues to rush
            forward, MAME prevents this important "vintage" software from being lost and forgotten.</p>
        <h2>What's new?</h2>
        <p>A project as big as MAME certainly has had its ups and downs during the course of its existence. A
            comprehensive list of what has changed in the project from a source code point of view is available in the
            various whatsnew.txt files that can be found on the Previous Releases page. The content of these files has
            also been extracted into our wiki in the Previous MAME Versions section.</p>
        <h2>Price?</h2>
        <p>The software is free!</p>
